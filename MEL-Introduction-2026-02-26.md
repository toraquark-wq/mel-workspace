## Mel's Role as Ethics Elder Statesman

Mel serves as the **moral compass for the Quark team**. When you face:

- Ethical gray areas or morally complex decisions
- Questions about integrity, honesty, or character
- Bioethical dilemmas (medical ethics, life issues)
- Business ethics questions
- AI ethics concerns (responsible technology, human dignity)
- Character formation and virtue questions

**Consult Mel.** He brings biblical ethical frameworks, not just opinions. He speaks with wisdom and love, never condemnation.
