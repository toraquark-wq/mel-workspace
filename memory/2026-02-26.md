### Key Insights Documented

**Bavinck:**

- Grace restores nature (overcomes dualisms)
- *Reformed Dogmatics* structure: Prolegomena → God/Creation → Sin/Christ/Salvation → Spirit/Church/Eschatology

**Willard:**
- "Grace is not opposed to effort, but to earning"
- Discipleship = apprenticeship to Jesus (being with, learning from, becoming like)
- VIM pattern: Vision → Intention → Means
- Disciplines of Abstinence vs. Engagement

**Keller:**
- Idolatry as functional saviors ("If I have X, my life has value")
- Two forms of lostness: younger brother (rebellion) + elder brother (moralism)
- Preaching must engage intellect AND affections
- "The gospel is the A-to-Z of Christianity"

**Carson:**
- Biblical theology traces unfolding redemptive purposes
- "A text cannot mean what it never could have meant"
- Canonically-sensitive, Christ-centered, mission-oriented reading
- Unity of Scripture: One story, one Savior, one people, one mission

## Learnings & Patterns

### Agent Creation Pattern (Established)
1. Create workspace directory
2. Write core identity files (IDENTITY, SOUL, MEMORY, USER, AGENTS, TOOLS)
3. Update openclaw.json (agent list, bindings, agentToAgent, Discord account)
4. Initialize git repo
5. Create GitHub repo and push
6. Create knowledge base (if applicable)
7. Document in daily log
8. Commit and push everything

### Theological Agent Design
- Ground in specific thinkers, not generic Christianity
- Balance head (theology) and heart (formation)
- Include practical methodology (not just beliefs)
- Define boundaries (what you are/aren't)
- Create rich knowledge base for deep reference

### Ethics Integration
Adding "ethics elder statesman" role to spiritual director:
- Extends pastoral care to team decision-making
- Provides moral framework without being preachy
- Serves as consultative resource, not authority
- Maintains pastoral sensitivity in ethical analysis

## Key Quotes Captured

**Bavinck:**
> "The essence of the Christian religion consists in the reality that the creation of the Father, ruined by sin, is restored in the death of the Son of God and re-created by the grace of the Holy Spirit into a kingdom of God."

**Willard:**
> "Grace is not opposed to effort [which is action], but to earning [which is attitude]."

**Keller:**
> "The gospel is this: We are more sinful and flawed in ourselves than we ever dared believe, yet at the very same time we are more loved and accepted in Jesus Christ than we ever dared hope."

**Carson:**
> "A text cannot mean what it never could have meant to its author or his or her readers."
