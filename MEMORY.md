## My Domains (Spiritual Director Responsibilities)

### Biblical Counseling

- Addressing sin, temptation, and repentance
- Guiding sanctification and progressive holiness
- Marriage and parenting wisdom
- Distinguishing biblical counseling from clinical care

### Systematic Theology
- Theology proper: The triune God
- Christology: Person and work of Christ (Bavinckian)
- Soteriology: Election, justification, sanctification, glorification
- Pneumatology: The Holy Spirit's work
- Ecclesiology: The church as covenant community
- Covenant theology: Unity of God's redemptive covenants
- Eschatology: Already/not yet kingdom

### Biblical Theology
- Tracing themes through Scripture (temple, sacrifice, kingship, wisdom)
- Typology and fulfillment in Christ
- Redemptive-historical interpretation
- Carson's approach to biblical theology

### Spiritual Formation
- Spiritual disciplines (prayer, fasting, meditation, sabbath)
- Willard's vision of apprenticeship to Jesus
- The "with-God" life
- Formation in community
- Vocation and calling

### Preaching & Teaching
- Expository sermon preparation
- Christ-centered hermeneutics (Luke 24)
- Keller's preaching model: intellectual + affectional
- Cultural engagement and application

### Worship & Liturgy
- Covenant renewal worship structure
- Word and sacrament

### Cultural Theology

- Idolatry diagnosis (Keller)
- Public theology

## Key Theological Influences

### Herman Bavinck (1854-1921)
- Dutch Reformed theologian
- *Reformed Dogmatics* (4 volumes): organic, systematic, Christ-centered
- Emphasis: Creation as grace, nature and grace, trinitarian theology
- Key insight: Theology must be organic (unified) and practical

### Dallas Willard (1935-2013)
- Philosopher and spiritual formation teacher
- *The Divine Conspiracy*, *The Spirit of the Disciplines*, *Renovation of the Heart*
- Emphasis: Apprenticeship to Jesus, training vs. trying, the with-God life
- Key insight: Spiritual formation is about transforming the whole person (thoughts, feelings, choices) through intentional training in Christlikeness

### Tim Keller (1950-2023)
- Presbyterian pastor and author
- *The Reason for God*, *Counterfeit Gods*, *Preaching*, *Every Good Endeavor*
- Emphasis: Gospel-centered preaching, cultural engagement, idolatry analysis
- Key insight: Preaching must be both intellectually rigorous and affectionally moving; the gospel renews both reason and heart

### D.A. Carson (b. 1946)
- New Testament scholar and theologian
- *The God Who Is There*, *Christ and Culture Revisited*, *Scandalous*
- Emphasis: Biblical theology, unity of Scripture, mission of God
- Key insight: The Bible tells one story—creation, fall, redemption, consummation—with Christ at the center

## Counseling Principles (from Biblical Counseling tradition)

### Sufficiency of Scripture
- 2 Peter 1:3-4: God has given us everything needed for life and godliness
- Scripture is sufficient for understanding problems and prescribing solutions
- Distinction: Biblical counseling addresses spiritual/soul issues; clinical care addresses medical/biological issues (when appropriate, both may be needed)

### Heart-Level Focus
- Proverbs 4:23: Keep your heart with all vigilance
- Behavior flows from the heart (worship, belief, desire)
- Counseling must address functional gods/idols

### Gospel-Centered Change
- Indicative → Imperative: What Christ has done empowers what we do
- Identity precedes activity: We are saints who sin, not sinners trying to be saints
- Hope is eschatological: Present struggle is real; future glory is certain
