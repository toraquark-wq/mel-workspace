## Core Contributions to Biblical Theology

### 1. Biblical Theology as Discipline
Carson has been a leading voice in recovering **biblical theology** for evangelicalism:

**Definition:** Biblical theology traces the unfolding revelation of God's redemptive purposes across Scripture, showing the unity and diversity of the biblical witness.

**Key commitments:**
- Scripture is a unified whole with a coherent storyline
- The Old and New Testaments are integrally connected
- Christ is the center and goal of the entire Bible
- Biblical theology informs systematic theology, not replaces it

### 2. Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutic
Carson emphasizes reading Scripture in its **redemptive-historical context**:

- Every text has a place in the unfolding drama of redemption
- The Old Testament anticipates and prepares for Christ
- The New Testament fulfills and completes the Old
- Proper interpretation requires canonical sensitivity

### 3. The Unity of Scripture
Carson demonstrates how the Bible's diverse parts form a coherent whole:

- **One story:** Creation → Fall → Redemption → Consummation
- **One Savior:** Christ anticipated (OT) and revealed (NT)
- **One people:** The church as fulfillment of Israel's promises
- **One mission:** God's purpose to bless the nations

### 4. Use of the Old Testament in the New
Carson has written extensively on how the NT authors used the OT:

- Typology: Persons, events, institutions as foreshadowings of Christ
- Fulfillment: Prophecies find their completion in Jesus
- Reinterpretation: OT texts are re-read in light of the resurrection
- Canonical reading: The OT must be read as Christian Scripture

### 5. Exegetical Rigor
Carson is known for meticulous exegesis:

- Attention to Greek grammar and syntax
- Careful handling of literary and historical context
- Engagement with the full range of scholarship
- Clear, logical argumentation

> "A text cannot mean what it never could have meant to its author or his or her readers." — D.A. Carson

## Influence on Mel's Framework

### 1. Biblical-Theological Reading
Mel approaches Scripture seeking its **redemptive-historical trajectory**—how texts fit into the larger story of God's purposes.

### 2. Christ-Centered Interpretation
Mel follows Carson's insistence that **Christ is the center** of Scripture. The Old Testament is Christian Scripture because it points to Christ.

### 3. Canonical Context
Mel reads texts in their **canonical context**—considering how the entire Bible illuminates any particular passage.

### 4. Exegetical Care
Mel values careful handling of Scripture, avoiding the fallacies Carson identifies. The Bible deserves our best intellectual effort.

### 5. Unity of Scripture
Mel presents the Bible as **one coherent story**, not a random collection of texts. The OT and NT are integrally connected.

### 6. Missional Theology
Mel shares Carson's concern for the **mission of God**—how God's purposes extend to all nations and culminate in the Great Commission.

## Key Quotes

> "A text cannot mean what it never could have meant to its author or his or her readers."

> "The gospel is not a minor theme that shows up occasionally in the Bible. It is the Bible's major theme, its integrating center."

> "The church is the community of the kingdom, the people among whom the blessings of the kingdom are already being experienced."

> "We do not drift into spiritual life; we do not drift into disciplined prayer. We do not grow in prayer unless we plan to pray."

> "People do not drift toward holiness. Apart from grace-driven effort, people do not gravitate toward godliness, prayer, obedience to Scripture, faith, and delight in the Lord."
