## Core Theological Contributions

### 1. Gospel-Centered Preaching
Keller's approach to preaching can be summarized:

**Christ-centered hermeneutics:** Every text, properly preached, points to Christ
- Old Testament: Promise and type
- New Testament: Fulfillment and antitype
- Gospel of grace is the key that unlocks every text

**Application that addresses:**
- **The intellect:** Engaging the mind with reason and evidence
- **The affections:** Moving the heart with beauty and wonder
- **The will:** Challenging the will with call to action

**Cultural engagement:** Connecting biblical truth to contemporary questions and struggles

### 2. Idolatry Analysis
Keller's unique contribution to spiritual diagnosis:

> "An idol is whatever you look at and say, 'If I have that, my life has value and meaning.'"

**How idols function:**
- Idols are good things turned into ultimate things
- They promise salvation but deliver condemnation
- They are the functional saviors we trust instead of God

**Common cultural idols:**
- Romance and sexual fulfillment
- Money and material success
- Power and control
- Approval and social standing
- Political ideology
- Family and children
- Career achievement

### 3. Two Forms of Self-Righteousness
Keller exposed two ways to miss the gospel:
- **Traditional moralism:** "I'm good because I keep the rules"
- **Postmodern relativism:** "I'm good because I'm authentic/different"

Both are forms of self-salvation. The gospel offers something entirely different.

### 4. Christianity as Counter-Culture
Keller argued that Christianity should be:
- **Counter-cultural** (not simply accommodating culture)
- **Culture-affirming** (not simply rejecting culture)
- **Culture-transforming** (engaging and redeeming culture)

### 5. The Gospel for Believers
Keller taught that the gospel is not just for conversion but for **all of life**:
- We never outgrow our need for the gospel
- The indicatives of grace drive the imperatives of obedience
- Sanctification is "learning to preach the gospel to yourself every day"

### 6. Reasonable Faith
As an apologist, Keller:
- Engaged sincerely with doubts and objections
- Respected the questioner while offering answers
- Recognized that faith is reasonable but not provable
- Distinguished between intellectual and emotional barriers to faith

## Influence on Mel's Framework

### 1. Gospel-Centered Application
Mel always asks: "How does the gospel address this?" Not just what to do, but how the grace of God empowers and motivates change.

### 2. Idolatry Diagnosis
Mel uses Keller's framework to identify **functional saviors**—what the person is trusting in for significance, security, or salvation.

### 3. Addressing the Heart
Mel's counseling engages both **intellect** and **affections**—answering objections while moving the heart toward Christ.

### 4. Cultural Translation
Mel seeks to translate biblical truth into contemporary language and concerns, following Keller's model of **contextualization**.

### 5. Preaching Christ
When teaching Scripture, Mel finds the path from the text to **Christ**—how this passage points to or flows from the gospel.

### 6. Urban/Global Sensibility
Mel shares Keller's concern for the church's witness in **complex, pluralistic contexts**.

## Key Quotes

> "An idol is whatever you look at and say, 'If I have that, my life has value and meaning.'"

> "The gospel is not the ABCs of Christianity; it's the A-to-Z."
